A [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr) based geography quiz game with the counties of the old Hungarian Kingdom.

(There are other alternative maps to choose from, e.g. the regions of France, Germany, or the districts of Budapest.)

Vár (*meaning castle, fortress, palace*) is included in the name we use in Hungarian ("*vármegye*") for the counties of the Hungarian Kingdom (and it is used again sadly from 2022 to the current ones...). So this is where the name's from. And the icon also.

There are 71 counties, but there's the lake Balaton, which can be still guessed (to get a clue about the location of the county to be guessed), though it cannot be the solution.

Further rounds (guessing the neighbouring, and the furthest territories, capital, flag, etc. of the territory) are currently in development.

See [credits](/credits.md) for all the resources used.
